# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A Streamlit web application that measures and analyzes developer productivity using GitHub API data. The system will collect various GitHub metrics, visualize them in an interactive dashboard, and provide AI-powered insights and summaries using ChatGPT API to help understand productivity patterns and trends.

## Glossary

- **GitHub_API_Client**: The component that interfaces with GitHub's REST API to fetch repository and user data
- **Streamlit_Dashboard**: The web-based user interface built with Streamlit framework for displaying metrics and visualizations
- **ChatGPT_Analyzer**: The component that uses OpenAI's ChatGPT API to analyze productivity data and generate insights
- **Productivity_Metrics**: Quantitative measurements of developer activity including commits, pull requests, code reviews, and issue resolution
- **Data_Collector**: The service responsible for gathering and processing GitHub data
- **Visualization_Engine**: The component that creates charts, graphs, and visual representations of productivity data
